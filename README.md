# uchicon-guidebook-app

Source code for the University of Chicago Japanese Animation ([UCJAS](http://jas.uchicago.edu/)) 
[UChi-con](https://www.uchi-con.com/) Guidebook Application. This application is built with 
[React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) so that it can be deployed on both iOS and Android platforms.
The production form of the app is distributed on both the Apple App Store and Google Play Store under 
the title **UChi-Con Guidebook**.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for 
development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

- Node Package Manager (npm)
- Expo CLI

### Running Locally

From the repository root, run:
```
$ npm start
```

This will use Expo to build and host the app on your local machine. It should also bring up a QR code 
along with instructions on how to view the app either on your smartphone or in a simulator on your 
desktop machine.

## Deployment
